                <p>Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but, basically, you make someone think the opposite of what you believe. And that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm. <br> Guess what? I have flaws. What are they? Oh I donno, I sing in the shower? Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me-- no, don't sue me. That is opposite the point I'm trying to make.</p>

                <p>In the Schrute family, we have a tradition where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of
                wild oats left on his doorstep by his parents. You can use those oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want, I don't
                care. They're your oats.

                First rule in road-side beet sales, put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and
                go, 'Wow. I need this beet right now.' Those are the money beets.

                I come from a long line of fighters, my maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. He
                killed twenty men and then spent the rest of the war in an Allied prison camp... My father battled blood pressure and
                obesity all his life... different kind of fight.</p>
